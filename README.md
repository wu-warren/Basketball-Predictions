# Basketball-Predictions

This project focuses on analyzing NBA game data to predict basketball game outcomes based on historical statistics and engineered features. Utilizing a dataset containing 2,460 games with 24 variables, we aim to construct predictive models by exploring the relationships between game statistics and results, using methods discussed in foundational texts on statistical learning (James et al., 2013). Feature engineering is a key aspect, including considerations of home advantage, team stability, and weighted averages of recent performances to better reflect current team capabilities. Our methodology involves preprocessing data, creating informative features, and training various machine learning models, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, to optimize predictive accuracy. By investigating these approaches, this study seeks to uncover insights into factors influencing game outcomes while improving prediction performance beyond established baselines.
